## 2026-05-14 22:20 — Plan A 5K60 theory and pending receiver benchmark

Prompt: `prompts/02_PLAN_A_5K60_FIRST_SPIKE.md`

Summary:
- Calculated 5120x2880 @ 60 raw RGB24 at 21.234Gbps before overhead.
- Calculated 5120x2880 @ 60 YUV 4:2:0 8-bit at 10.617Gbps before overhead.
- Created the Windows D3D11 synthetic renderer benchmark path, but did not run it because this session is on macOS without the Windows SDK and without the Windows iMac receiver.

Artifacts:
- `benchmarks/theory/5k60_bandwidth.md`
- `benchmarks/plans/windows_synthetic_renderer.md`
- `benchmarks/plans/transport_benchmark.md`
- `benchmarks/runs/2026-05-14_2220_plan_a_pending/summary.md`

Decision:
- Continue Plan A until the Windows iMac local render benchmark and transport measurements exist.
